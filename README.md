# Order summary component

![Responsive mockup](design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my solution to the [order summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/order-summary-component-m1KK9bOnj). Frontend Mentor is a platform where developers can learn and improve their frontend development skills alongside other developers by implementing solutions to challenges. Each challenge includes designs (both mobile and desktop), assets, and a style guide to get you started. The rest is up to you!

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

I don't have access to the premium Figma/Sketch files, so the design is not pixel perfect.
